Do not modify the name of directories or files.

1. Export Files from ISO.
Choose a clean copy of the ISO for the input file, and then a directory of your choice for the second. I suggest chosing a new directory named something like "packed" since it represents the folder of packed files.

2. Unpack FPKs in Directory.
Choose the root folder inside of the directory we previously chose ("packed" in this case). Then pick a new folder outside of the first folder to unpack to. I suggest chosing a new directory named something like "unpacked" since it represents the folder of unpacked files.

3. Modify files in "unpacked" folder.
