## Log an Issue

Open an Issue on the Github page under Issues. If it is a defect, please include the logs and an explanation of what you were trying to do. Logs can be found in your home directory and will start with fpk (e.g. `fpkjava0.log.0`). Five logs for separate instances can exist at one time, but just include them all with any defect request.

## Contribute Code

If you would like to contribute code, please open a pull request and I will try and review it in a timely manner.

Here are some recommendations for creating a local development environment for GNTool:

  - File → Settings → Editor → Code Style → Select the small gear icon next to "Scheme", select Import Scheme → IntelliJ IDEA code style XML.
